[What you did to fix it and get your tests to pass]

---------------------------------------------------


1. Animal Group Name
Description: The test is case-sensitive when it should work regardless of case.
Fix: Because the test already worked with the animal name in all lowercase, I chose to start from there. I made
a new variable that would change the String input into all lowercase and then compare the results.


2. Cigar Party
Description: The test case did not include 40 and 60 cigars.
Fix: The less than and greater than signs were changed to less than or equal to and greater than or equal to.

3. Front Times
Description: The number of times the front is repeating is one less that the integer given.
Fix: Fix the n to be <n instead of < n-1 for the loops.


4. Less 20
Description: Does not account for 1 or 2 less than 20.
Fix: The variable used for testing was this.n and it was not set to equal the n which we actually wanted to test.
Fixed it by making this.n = n.

5. Lucky 13
Description: The test is returning false for arrays that do not have a 1 or a 3.
Fix: The test was using an AssertFalse for a scenario that was supposed to return true. So it kept failing. It was
changed to AssertTrue.

6. Word Count

Description: It is not counting the words that are duplicated.
Fix: The Word Count class was checking for values when it should have been testing for keys. I changed containsValue
to containsKey.
